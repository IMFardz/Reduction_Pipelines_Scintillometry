# Reduction_Pipelines_Scintillometry
Python scripts used to create waterfalls / folds given baseband data.

Uses packages such as:
scintillometry: github.com/mhvk/scintillometry
baseband: github.com/mhvk/baseband
astropy
numpy
scipy

NOTES:

If you are interested in seeing how I use the new scintillometry package, please see the scint_scripts directory

Folding scripts contains a few scripts I wrote myself. If you are interested in seeing how to fold pulsar data, this may be a useful reference

The Other directory contains some random scripts, some old some new, that you may find helpful.
